# Yarub_library
n this Omdena project, our goal was to develop open-source Python Arabic NLP libraries that the Arab world will easily use in all Natural Language Processing applications like Morphological analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Word Embedding, Dialect Identification, Part of speech, and so on the training dataset. This article contains interesting code and could be beneficial for whatever your level of experience, but for beginners, it is a great start-up in data collection using web scraping with referral links to official documentation pages for every mentioned library.
